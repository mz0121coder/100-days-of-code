# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Flashcards, codewars katas, finished my final project for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification. Will complete another chapter of 'Learn HTML/CSS' later today. 

**Thoughts:** It was good to complete the first 2 FCC certifications and add them to my LinkedIn profile, this was a goal I set for myself to finish before starting the School of Code full time training.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
