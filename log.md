# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Flashcards, codewars katas, finished my final project for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification. Will complete another chapter of 'Learn HTML/CSS' later today. 

**Thoughts:** It was good to complete the first 2 FCC certifications and add them to my LinkedIn profile, this was a goal I set for myself to finish before starting the School of Code full time training.

### Day 2: March 13, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Great overview by the School of Code CEO, covering computational thinking, teamwork and best practices. He also shared an interesting video relating to performace and relaxation. Met some of my fellow programmers embarking on this journey. Practiced with CSS diner, revisited FCC functional programming challenges, did 3 codewars katas. Will review flashcards before calling it a day. 

**Thoughts:** Today really emphasised the importance of breaking problems down and looking for repeatable patterns. Also learned about the importance of sleep/exercise and enjoyed the energisers and meeting new people.

### Day 3: March 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Very nice challenge to build a basic Scratch game with a partner in 90 minutes. Practiced git cloning, adding commits and pushing back to a main branch. Completed 2 chapters of 'Learn HTML/CSS'. Also did a good debugging kata that reinforced attention to detail. Ending the day with flashcards.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed the game challenge and discussions on problem solving, but it is time to get more hands on and write code in JavaScript. Also getting better at Git workflow with practice.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
