# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Flashcards, codewars katas, finished my final project for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification. Will complete another chapter of 'Learn HTML/CSS' later today. 

**Thoughts:** It was good to complete the first 2 FCC certifications and add them to my LinkedIn profile, this was a goal I set for myself to finish before starting the School of Code full time training.

### Day 2: March 13, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Great overview by the School of Code CEO, covering computational thinking, teamwork and best practices. He also shared an interesting video relating to performace and relaxation. Met some of my fellow programmers embarking on this journey. Practiced with CSS diner, revisited FCC functional programming challenges, did 3 codewars katas. Will review flashcards before calling it a day. 

**Thoughts:** Today really emphasised the importance of breaking problems down and looking for repeatable patterns. Also learned about the importance of sleep/exercise and enjoyed the energisers and meeting new people.

### Day 3: March 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Very nice challenge to build a basic Scratch game with a partner in 90 minutes. Practiced git cloning, adding commits and pushing back to a main branch. Completed 2 chapters of 'Learn HTML/CSS'. Also did a good debugging kata that reinforced attention to detail. Ending the day with flashcards.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed the game challenge and discussions on problem solving, but it is time to get more hands on and write code in JavaScript. Also getting better at Git workflow with practice.

### Day 4: March 15, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript fundamentals - variables, functions, loops. Practiced building a password checker in an enjoyable pair programming session. Energy was lower so did 2 relatively simple katas to keep the momentum going. Ended the day with flashcards from Jad Joubran's frontend courses. 

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed the pair programming and getting more involved with code in the browser. Despite having less energy I still did some practice and revisited the lessons in the evening. Consistency is key.

### Day 5: March 16, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: There was a very informative mindset session, followed by more JavaScript fundamentals - topics included non-primitive data types (objects), array methods, dot and bracket notation, and nested/complex arrays. Finished the day by recapping with flashcards and also practiced the concepts with 2 katas that involved filtering and sorting arrays in ascending and descending order. 

**Thoughts:** Pair programming was very useful as it allowed both myself and my partner to understand the ideas better by explaining things to each other and asking questions. This will be a key skill in a tech role and I am grateful to be able to practice this regularly. Looking forward to more mindset and performance psychology sessions on Thursdays.

### Day 6: March 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first hackathon, where I coded a rock, paper, scissors game with a partner. We used regex to validate usernames, and switch statements to handle different scores based on the player's selection and randomly generated computer moves. Ended an incredible first week at the School of Code. Practiced a little CSS and reviewed flashcards. Getting some rest before reviewing JavaScript fundamentals over the weekend. 

**Thoughts:** The highlights of the week included meeting and working with great people, practical training in problem solving from the coaches and of course today's hackathon. I am looking forward to doing more of these challenges on Fridays.

### Day 7: March 18, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some of the concepts from this week by practicing JavaScript challenges on FreeCodeCamp and completing a few katas. I coded a very long solution for one of the katas, took a break and realised I could do the same thing in 2 lines with regex. 

**Thoughts:** While it is good to make a plan before solving a problem, sometimes taking a break can give a fresh perspective, like I saw with the challenge.

### Day 8: March 19, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Recap of regex and data structures. Completed another chapter of 'Learn HTML/CSS'. Did a few katas and flashcards. Solved a string expansion challenge that I was previously stuck on for a while.  

**Thoughts:** Productive weekend. Ready to go again tomorrow.

### Day 9: March 20, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: DOM selection and methods, practicing querySelector, appendChild, textContent, event listeners etc. Enjoyed programming with my group. Added extra functionality to a 'penny doubling' page in a workshop - toggle dark mode, hover effect and max width + text align for a more responsive layout. Flashcards and a kata in the evening.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to more DOM practice and using these techniques in projects.

### Day 10: March 21, 2023

Today's Progress: More progress with the DOM. Deployed a simple rock paper scissors game, more group programming and guidance on using AI tools to increase efficiency as a developer. Had a great first meeting with my mentor and a talk from a previous SoC student. Started a food tracker project to practice the concepts further. 

Thoughts: Overall a good day.

### Day 11: March 22, 2023

Today's Progress: Async JavaScript - setTimeout, setInterval, promises and fetch. Built a visual clock and cat fact generator. 

Thoughts: Async can be tricky so I will keep reviewing it this week and onwards as needed.

### Day 12: March 23, 2023

Today's Progress: Morning quiz on async concepts, thursday mindset session and guest talk from a UX/UI designer. Group research task and codewars in the evening. Also styled the JavaScript clock from yesterday's workshop. 

Thoughts: The mindset session stressed the importance of being flexible and incorporating everyone's strengths and personalities when working as a team. This will be very useful for future projects and jobs.

### Day 13: March 24, 2023

Today's Progress: Friday hackathon - collaborated with 2 other developers to build a quiz game. Used a trivia API to fetch random multiple choice questions, stored the possible answers in an array and updated the displayed score and message as the user plays the game. A great way to practice everything covered in the last 2 weeks. Also given some individual tasks for the weekend which will reinforce this knowledge. 

Thoughts: This week has been intense and very rewarding. I will get some rest before reviewing DOM/fetch over the weekend and completing more katas and flashcards.

### Day 14: March 25, 2023

Today's Progress: Reviewed DOM/Async/Fetch with some weekend tasks, and completed a few katas. 

Thoughts: A good day to recap things and also take some time to relax and recharge.

### Day 15: March 26, 2023

Today's Progress: Finished weekend tasks, codewars katas, practiced CSS ahead of UI/UX week. 

Thoughts: Good weekend, ready to again tomorrow.

### Day 16: March 27, 2023

Today's Progress: Introduction to UI/UX and agile software development, and a guest talk from SRE (site reliability engineer). 
Practiced CSS flexbox and grid with 2 games. Meeting with my mentor. Flashcards and codewars. 

Thoughts: Very informative talk on alternative pathways into tech, and the importance of regular testing/quality checks. 
Also enjoyed the CSS games and guidance on breaking up projects and reviewing regularly, versus the waterfall approach.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
