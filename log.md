# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Flashcards, codewars katas, finished my final project for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification. Will complete another chapter of 'Learn HTML/CSS' later today. 

**Thoughts:** It was good to complete the first 2 FCC certifications and add them to my LinkedIn profile, this was a goal I set for myself to finish before starting the School of Code full time training.

### Day 2: March 13, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Great overview by the School of Code CEO, covering computational thinking, teamwork and best practices. He also shared an interesting video relating to performace and relaxation. Met some of my fellow programmers embarking on this journey. Practiced with CSS diner, revisited FCC functional programming challenges, did 3 codewars katas. Will review flashcards before calling it a day. 

**Thoughts:** Today really emphasised the importance of breaking problems down and looking for repeatable patterns. Also learned about the importance of sleep/exercise and enjoyed the energisers and meeting new people.

### Day 3: March 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Very nice challenge to build a basic Scratch game with a partner in 90 minutes. Practiced git cloning, adding commits and pushing back to a main branch. Completed 2 chapters of 'Learn HTML/CSS'. Also did a good debugging kata that reinforced attention to detail. Ending the day with flashcards.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed the game challenge and discussions on problem solving, but it is time to get more hands on and write code in JavaScript. Also getting better at Git workflow with practice.

### Day 4: March 15, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript fundamentals - variables, functions, loops. Practiced building a password checker in an enjoyable pair programming session. Energy was lower so did 2 relatively simple katas to keep the momentum going. Ended the day with flashcards from Jad Joubran's frontend courses. 

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed the pair programming and getting more involved with code in the browser. Despite having less energy I still did some practice and revisited the lessons in the evening. Consistency is key.

### Day 5: March 16, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: There was a very informative mindset session, followed by more JavaScript fundamentals - non-primitive data types (objects), array methods, dot and bracket notation. Nested/complex arrays. Finished the day by recapping concepts with flashcards and also practiced the concepts with 2 katas that involved filtering and sorting arrays in ascending and descending order. 

**Thoughts:** Pair programming was very useful as it allowed both myself and my partner to understand the ideas better by explaining things to each other and asking questions. This will be a key skill in a tech role and I am grateful to be able to practice this regularly. Looking forward to more mindset and performance psychology sessions on Thursdays.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
