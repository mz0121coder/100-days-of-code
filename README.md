# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Flashcards, codewars katas, finished my final project for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification. Will complete another chapter of 'Learn HTML/CSS' later today. 

**Thoughts:** It was good to complete the first 2 FCC certifications and add them to my LinkedIn profile, this was a goal I set for myself to finish before starting the School of Code full time training.

### Day 2: March 13, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Great overview by the School of Code CEO, covering computational thinking, teamwork and best practices. He also shared an interesting video relating to performace and relaxation. Met some of my fellow programmers embarking on this journey. Practiced with CSS diner, revisited FCC functional programming challenges, did 3 codewars katas. Will review flashcards before calling it a day. 

**Thoughts:** Today really emphasised the importance of breaking problems down and looking for repeatable patterns. Also learned about the importance of sleep/exercise and enjoyed the energisers and meeting new people.

### Day 5: March 16, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** There was a very informative mindset session, followed by more JavaScript fundamentals - topics included non-primitive data types (objects), array methods, dot and bracket notation, and nested/complex arrays. Finished the day by recapping with flashcards and also practiced the concepts with 2 katas that involved filtering and sorting arrays in ascending and descending order. 

**Thoughts:** Pair programming was very useful as it allowed both myself and my partner to understand the ideas better by explaining things to each other and asking questions. This will be a key skill in a tech role and I am grateful to be able to practice this regularly. Looking forward to more mindset and performance psychology sessions on Thursdays.

### Day 6: March 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** Completed my first hackathon, where I coded a rock, paper, scissors game with a partner. We used regex to validate usernames, and switch statements to handle different scores based on the player's selection and randomly generated computer moves. Ended an incredible first week at the School of Code. Practiced a little CSS and reviewed flashcards. Getting some rest before reviewing JavaScript fundamentals over the weekend. 

**Thoughts:** The highlights of the week included meeting and working with great people, practical training in problem solving from the coaches and of course today's hackathon. I am looking forward to doing more of these challenges on Fridays.

### Day 63: May 11th, 2023. 

**Today's Progress:** - Overview of REST APIs, had a guest talk from Nadeem & Ely at Talis on this topic. Continued yesterday's group workshop by implementing basic middleware. I will probably review notes & react flashcards later in the day. 

**Thoughts:** It will take some time for the new concepts to sink in but I'm looking forward to the hackathon tomorrow, it will be a good way to practice. 

### Day 64: May 12th, 2023. 

**Today's Progress:** - Reinforcement of this week's concepts in the Friday hackathon, where my group & I built the backend for a recipes app. 

These were the main objectives, which we mostly managed to complete: 

- Build a back end server for an application that includes CRUD functionality for a recipe collection ✅
- Populate and test the routes for the API endpoints using the requirements table ✅
- Create and export functions in recipes.js file to interact with the recipe collection ✅
- Hook up the helper functions to the API endpoints in app.js file and ensure the responses include an expected payload key ✅
- Optional bonus challenges include joining up to the front end ✅ with fetch requests and adding middleware to the app (in progress)

We worked at a steady pace and added comments to the main JS file for the frontend which included several event listeners and callback functions. I also refactored code to follow the DRY principle and be more concise. I might revisit this on the weekend to polish the app further and incorporate middleware. 

**Thoughts:** A great week and fantastic team work. The habit of regularly commenting & organising code is paying off, especially as we work on more complex projects. 

Link to work: [Rest API Hackathon](https://github.com/mz0121coder/rest-api-hackathon)

### Day 65: May 13th, 2023. 

**Today's Progress:** - Refactored some of the code from project week. Created a data folder to store the arrays of questions (used for the flashcards). Cleaned up the CSS files and deployed to Netlify. Also changed the image used for the main heading animation. Solved a 4 kyu kata (only did this once before). 

**Thoughts:** - Keeping the code relatively organised in the project week was very useful, now that I revisited it 2-3 weeks later, I could look back at the main sections and find what I needed to change very easily. Going back to the backend tomorrow for this week's recap task.
